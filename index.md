This site is a collaborative effort, built with software from the [OpenPolitics project](https://openpolitics.org.uk). It's a bit like a wiki, but with voting, and backed by [git](https://git-scm.com), an advanced version control system.

* Anyone can edit a page - just click "suggest a change" in the top right.
* Once a suggestion is made, anyone can vote on whether or not it's accepted. Click "View proposals" above to see the current proposals.
