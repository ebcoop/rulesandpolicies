    **deficiency** means the amount of accumulated loss, deficiency or significant change disclosed in the last balance sheet of the co-operative, or later reported before expulsion.

4. Subject to subrule (5) and the written terms of a class of share issued, the co-operative must, however, pay to the expelled or resigning member the amount of capital paid up on the former member’s shares at the time of expulsion or resignation (less any amount owing by the former member to the co- operative).

5. If a deficiency exists, an appropriate proportion of the loss, deficiency or significant change may be deducted from the amount of capital paid up on the shares of the expelled or resigning member. This is done having regard to the number of shares held by the expelled or resigning member immediately before expulsion or resignation in relation to the number of shares in the co-operative.

6. Subject to section 128 of the Law, payment to the expelled or resigning member of any amount owing by the co-operative to the former member:

    a) must be made at the time decided by the board but within one year from the date of expulsion or resignation; or
   
    b) may be applied at the time decided by the board, but within one year from the date of expulsion or resignation, in the manner set out in section 128 of the Law, if there is agreement by the board and former member or if the board considers that repayment would adversely affect the financial position of the co-operative.


#### 12 Suspension of members

1. The co-operative may suspend a member for not more than one year, who does any of the following:

    a) contravenes any of these rules;
   
    b) fails to discharge obligations to the co-operative, whether under these rules or a contract;
    
    c) acts detrimentally to the interests of the co-operative.
    
2. In order to suspend a member, the procedure for expulsion of a member set out in rule 9 is to be followed as if references to expulsion were references to suspension.

3. During the period of suspension, the member:

    a) loses any rights (except the right to vote) arising as a result of membership; and
   
    b) is not entitled to a refund, rebate, relief or credit for membership fees paid, or payable, to the co- operative; and
    
    c) remains liable for any fine that may be imposed.



### Division 2 Dispute resolution

    a) a member and another member; or

    b) a member (including a former member) and the co-operative.

2. If a dispute arises, a party cannot commence any court or arbitration proceedings relating to the dispute unless it has complied with the provisions of this rule, except where a person seeks urgent interlocutory relief.

    a) for a dispute between a member and another member, a person appointed by the board; or
    
    b) for a dispute between a member (including a former member) and the co-operative, a person appointed by the Australian Mediation Association.
    
6. The mediator may (but need not) be a member of the co-operative, unless the member is a party to the dispute.

7. The parties to the dispute must, in good faith, attempt to settle the dispute by mediation.

8. The mediator, in conducting the mediation, must:

    a) give the parties to the mediation process every opportunity to be heard; and

    b) allow due consideration by all parties of any written statement submitted by any party; and

    c) ensure that natural justice is accorded to the parties to the dispute throughout the mediation process.

9. The mediator cannot determine the dispute. 
 
10. The mediation must be confidential and without prejudice.

11. The costs of the mediation are to be shared equally between the parties unless otherwise agreed. 

12. Nothing in this rule applies to any dispute as to the construction or effect of any mortgage or contract contained in any document other than these rules.

13. Nothing in this rule applies to any dispute involving the expulsion or suspension of a member or the imposition of a fine.

14. If the mediation process does not result in the dispute being resolved, each party may seek to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Law or otherwise at law.

7. An amount that, under the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable on allotment or at a fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, is for these rules taken to be a call made and payable on the day that, under the terms of issue, the amount becomes payable. If the amount is not paid, all relevant provisions of these rules about payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise apply as if the amount had become payable under a call properly made and notified.

2. The notice must name a further day (not earlier than 14 days after the date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made and must state that, in the event of non- payment at or before the time appointed, the shares for which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited

1. A person becoming entitled to be a shareholder because of the death, bankruptcy or incapacity of the holder is entitled to the dividends and other advantages to which the person would be entitled if he or she were the registered holder of the share or shares.

2. A person registered as holder of the shares of a member who has died, or is bankrupt or incapable of managing his or her affairs, has the same liabilities in relation to the share or shares as those to which the deceased, bankrupt or incapable person would have been liable if he or she had remained a member with full legal capacity.

>**Note 1.** A small co-operative must prepare and send to members minimum financial statements that are specified in regulation 3.10 of the National Regulations (these are referred as “basic minimum financial statements”).

2. Unless these rules state otherwise, 5 members (or 50% of total members entitled to vote rounded up to the nearest whole member, whatever is the lesser amount) present in person, each being entitled to exercise a vote, constitute a quorum.

3. If a quorum is not present within half an hour after the appointed time for a meeting, the meeting, if called on the requisition of members, must be dissolved. In any other case it must be adjourned to the same day, time and place in the next week.

4. If a quorum is not present within half an hour after the time appointed for an adjourned meeting, the members present constitute a quorum.


#### 35 Chairperson at general meetings

1. The chairperson, if any, of the board may preside as chairperson at every general meeting of the co-operative.

2. If there is no chairperson, or if at a meeting the chairperson is either not present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairperson, the members present must choose someone from their number to be chairperson (until the chairperson attends and is willing to act).

3. The chairperson may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and must if directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place. However, the only business that can be transacted at an adjourned meeting is the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for 14 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given just as for the original meeting. Apart from this it is not necessary to give notice of an adjournment or the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting.

    a) the chairperson directs that the question is to be determined by a poll; or
    
    b) at least 5 members present in person or represented by proxy demand a poll; the question for decision must be determined by a poll.
    
9. The poll must be taken when and in the manner that the chairperson directs.
 
10. A poll on the election of a chairperson or on the question of adjournment must be taken immediately and without debate.

11.   Once the votes on a show of hands or on a poll have been counted then, subject to subrule (8), a declaration by the chairperson that a resolution has been carried (unanimously or by a particular majority) or lost is evidence of that fact.

12. The result of the vote must be entered in the minute book.

    d) represented by a proxy (but only if proxies are allowed under these rules); has one vote.

> **Note 1.** A person can hold an unlimited number of proxies unless the rules restrict the number of proxies any one person can hold. If the vote on a show of hands is likely not to represent the views of the members who have given a proxy, a poll may be demanded. Section 256(2) of the Law provides that a question is to be decided by a poll if a poll is required by the chairperson of the meeting or by any 5 members present at the meeting or represented at the meeting by proxy.

> **Note 2.** Most decisions are made by ordinary resolution, but in certain cases the Law requires a special resolution.

5. If the board decides to conduct a secret postal ballot, it must ensure that the method used to conduct the ballot will ensure that votes can be counted without identifying the way each member has voted.

6. The board is to appoint a returning officer to conduct the postal ballot. In default of such an appointment, the secretary is the returning officer.

7. Ballot papers (in such form and with such content as the board may approve) must be sent to all voting members giving:
